psutil experiment
=================

I found [psutil](https://code.google.com/p/psutil/), which looks like it may be useful in these early stages. Here's a quick experiment I whipped up with it. To run:

* Install psutil, twisted, and autobahn (`pip install autobahn twisted psutil`).
* Run the server (`python ws.py`).
* See <http://localhost:8000/>.
